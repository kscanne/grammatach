  # This asserts that at least one of the piped values *must* be there
  # (despite the slightly confusing attribute name "permitted")
  # "None" is permitted as a feature value; if it appears alone,
  # then the constraint means the feature should not appear at all.
  # If it appears piped together with other values, e.g. "Ecl|Len|None",
  # then the other values might appear, but not necessarily.
  # Also allowed to specify a negated feature value (other than "None"):
  # for example, "!Len" means that Len should *not* appear for this feature.
  # NB Doesn't make sense to have more than one negated term, since that
  # would then allow anything; we prefer listing all permitted values
  # in that case, together with "None": "Ecl|Len|None"
